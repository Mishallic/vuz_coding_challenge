What I would do to improve on my solution?
- transform the data: 1- flatten the tags to become an array of strings 2- maybe transform the abilities to an object.
- create new types for transformed data.
- create helpers for functions such as reducer, getabilities, gettags, average.
- disect the table component into multiple components: table, tableHeader, tableCell.
- group types in a dedicated file like the one provided by the challenge.
- create a custom hook for the scrolling listener.
- create 'go to top' button.
- make sure the page is completely responsive and styling.
- parse the tags and render them on screen, also apply them to the filter. (comments added in the code)
- optimize images.
- optimize the select mechanism, it's kinda slow, and will be slower if there was more records on the screen.
- make sure data is consistant(all characters have tags and abilities)
- cover all search performance edge cases.
- organize and optimize imports.
